The details of how this works are not\nimportant for now. All you need to know is how to launch a Pythia\nCookbooks chapter via Binder. Simply navigate your mouse to\nthe top right corner of the book chapter you are viewing and click\non the rocket ship icon, (see figure below), and be sure to select\n“launch Binder”. After a moment you should be presented with a\nnotebook that you can interact with. I.e. you’ll be able to execute\nand even change the example programs. You’ll see that the code cells\nhave no output at first, until you execute them by pressing\nShift+Enter. Complete details on how to interact with\na live Jupyter notebook are described in \n\nGetting Started with\nJupyter.\n\nNote, not all Cookbook chapters are executable. If you do not see\nthe rocket ship icon, such as on this page, you are not viewing an\nexecutable book chapter.","type":"content","url":"/#running-on-binder","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"xmACIS2Py Cookbook","lvl3":"Running on Your Own Machine","lvl2":"Running the Notebooks"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/#running-on-your-own-machine","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"xmACIS2Py Cookbook","lvl3":"Running on Your Own Machine","lvl2":"Running the Notebooks"},"content":"If you are interested in running this material locally on your computer, you will need to follow this workflow:\n\n(Replace “cookbook-example” with the title of your cookbooks)\n\nClone the https://github.com/ProjectPythia/xmacis2py-cookbook repository: git clone https://github.com/ProjectPythia/xmacis2py-cookbook.git\n\nMove into the cookbook-example directorycd xmacis2py-cookbook\n\nCreate and activate your conda environment from the environment.yml fileconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate xmacis2py-cookbook-dev\n\nMove into the notebooks directory and start up Jupyterlabcd notebooks/\njupyter lab","type":"content","url":"/#running-on-your-own-machine","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"How to Cite This Cookbook"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/how-to-cite","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"How to Cite This Cookbook"},"content":"The material in this Project Pythia Cookbook is licensed for free and open consumption and reuse.
